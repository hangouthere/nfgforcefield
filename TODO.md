# TODO:

## Phase 1

When this Phase is complete, that means we are able to start using it on the NFGArmy server!

-   ReDo namespacing... currently `nfg_forcefield:blah`, should be `nfg:forcefield/blah`... tedius, but cleaner grouping of my work
-   Check/clean up things that maybe shouldn't happen in Creative Mode
    -   Corner Knockbacks shouldn't affect creative mode ppl
-   Clean up/review all docs
-   Look into optimizing some tick functionality, not everything needs to be done EVERY tick
    -   Clean up entity selectors, esp when copy/writing data... Use storage as temp location, then store on Entity at end
    -   Corner deletion/creation updates kinda stuff? every 10-20t
    -   Corner tooltip updates could be every 10t
    -   Double check scores (esp `store result score`) to make sure scopes are isolated (easiest via unique names)
-   Player Book
    -   Basic configuration/information
    -   on/off? (will change later to cost players, don't overengineer this yet)
    -   mob/build shape settings? (will change later to cost players, don't overengineer this yet)
-   `ff_admin` should be able to destroy/update ALL ForceFields!
    -   Might need some light logic duplication but check for ff_admin instead of owner

Things to Test:

-   2 players placing at the same time
    -   1 player deleting while placing
    -   Actionbar is giving accurate info
    -   Have players run through eachother to see if helper's swap

## Phase 2

-   Split up nfgUtil and nfgForceField repos, and include build zip for nfgUtil in nfgForceField
-   Per-FF Configuration
    -   FF Mods: Perim vs Volume, Mob vs Build (see Different Approach below)
    -   Option to make corners invisible (off by default)
    -   Option to make corners hide tooltips (off by default)
    -   Heals at all?
        -   Enable Setting
        -   Maybe after some delay (setting)?
    -   Fancy particles indicating internal to FF?
    -   Corner sparkles of sorts?
        -   Maybe following perimeter?
    -   Sounds
        -   Separate ambient vs zap
    -   Complex idea with chest+books...
        -   ~~Messaging:
            -   ~~Incoming Title/Subtitle/ActionBar/~~Server Text
            -   ~~Outgoing Title/Subtitle/ActionBar/~~Server Text
-   Assignable Forcefields
    -   ~~Need to basically track ID to player~~
    -   ~~Adds features/capabilities based on matching ID (or mismatching ID)~~
    -   Multiple players can match an ID for "tribes"
-   ReadMe Stuffs
    -   Explain Volume vs Perimeter Shapes
    -   Explain Mob vs Build Protection
    -   Explain Power Mods
    -   Explain Settings
    -   Explain Scanning Process(es?)
    -   Explain Suspension system (for optimization)
        -   How settings relate to tweaking for your own server

## Phase 3 / Nice to Haves

-   Constructable ForceFields
    -   Requires Assignable to be functioning or it's just not worthwhile
    -   Needs to be VERY expensive!
    -   Consider either floor crafting,
-   Deeper Admin Tools
    -   Orphaned/Broken FF's? (somehow not properly deleted)
    -   Reset Suspends to fix broken perma-suspends
-   Corner updates on occassion?
    -   Items might be moved due to gravity, might need minor updates from time to time
-   Idea for Corner Markers (while placing):
    -   When user places starting corner, use a light block of some sort (for long distance view)
        -   When moving away from the corner, the block should move upward the same amount to visually see (maybe cap height?)
            -   ONLY allow/move block if block is air

## Completed!

-   Settings:
    -   Initial setup:
        -   Detected via hidden semaphore: `#_doneInit ff_calcs`, 1.. is true
        -   Doesn't require special tag, but also gives it to the player: `ff_admin`
        -   Convert weird localstorage settings loading of settings to this lifecycle
        -   Should give a Book to describe how everything works
    -   Admin Helper Book
        -   **Page 1: Overview**
            -   Force-Give Building Pieces
            -   `ff_admin` to Nearby: [Give] | [Take]
            -   [Give Player Helper Book]
            -   Player's ID
        -   **Page 2: Intro**
            -   Should clearly detail that tags need to be given to players to perform similar actions
            -   This book is meant to help you learn about ForceFields, as well as how they operate, and the different ways you can use them
        -   **Page 3: About FF**
            -   Describe how a FF works
            -   Volume vs Perimeter
            -   Mob vs Build
-   Convert to new scan technique:
    -   Need to add datastructure saving to the env
        -   Startup needs to define the template
        -   Need to copy over the process of calc vs saving ff data, i liked the split...
        -   Probably don't need the metadata in the forcefield anymore?
            -   Got rid of some, keeping some for tooltips
    -   Power mod: Both on/off at same time causes freak-out
    -   Get rid of all traces of option to make corners force chunks
    -   Get rid of max settings, keep min settings?
    -   Use actual scan technique in the sandbox
    -   Needs check added to ignore forever-more? Tricky because they could be far from one forcefield, but not another ðŸ¤”
        -   Consensus marking for "perma-ignore": Mark as far away if far away, close if close... at the end of the FF loop, we clear both tags for `close`+`far` combo'd entities since they're nearby another field... `close`-only can technically keep it's tag (or can lose it), far only keeps it's tags and ignored on future scans
    -   Clean up `ff_processed_` tags, make them less junky if possible
-   Clean up scanning namespace in storage... uses _scan_\*, should be isolated to namespaces!
-   Mob Protection
    -   Kill & Zap, like current implementation, but with new technique
    -   Needs to include betteranimalsplus hostile mobs
-   Clean up Scanning so it's easy to split off for Mob vs Build protection
-   Build Protection
    -   Needs to tell user on Entry
    -   Needs to put into Adventure mode on Entry
    -   Needs to tell user on Exit
    -   Needs to put into Survival mode on Exit
    -   Added: New buffer perim for protecting against destroying corners/etc
-   Get rid of DEBUG completely - (left sprinkled in for scanning)
-   DELETE `end_crystal_target`, or do something with it, or next row....
-   Delete all of `__ARCHIVE` junk
-   Fix validation errors for non-creative players - they lose the corners!
-   Deleting a forcefield
    -   existing needs redo, score won't work if you go out of chunk and kills the FF's
        -   remove concept of score pair :(
    -   needs to remove from the array to stop future processing
    -   Corners in unloaded chunks need handling
        -   Store for deletion later
        -   On corner scan test if we need to delete
    -   Needs to return corners, and not dropped items
-   Refactor `tag.ff` to `tag.ff`
-   Look at combining `placing` and `config` into same namespace since they're practically related
    -   It should require more cleanup of `placing` as well, building deeper namespaces and general cleanup
-   Fix namespaces to be tighter
    -   get rid of prefix-underscores in all namespaces
    -   Considered NS':
        -   scanner
            -   current (replaces current)
            -   list (replaces ForceFields)
        -   operations
            -   create
            -   delete
            -   meta
                -   id_found
                -   id_break
                -   id_test
-   Consider different/updated approaches:
    -   upgrades to combine forcefield types? Mob + Build
    -   Tooltips will need update
    -   Update error checks to go off data on helper instead of corner
        -   ending can't be placed because start can't be detected
    -   Stranger vs Owner messages when entering/leaving FF?
    -   Corner creation beyond chunk loadings need to function properly
        -   maybe sorta opposite of delete process?
        -   Update corner ID's/meta for tooltips, and owner evaluations
            -   don't forget process of out of chunk load!
    -   No start/end concept, just --CORNER--
    -   Remove `ff_prot_build`, `ff_prob_mob` concept (will later use data!!)
    -   Update labeling to get rid of mob vs build protection wording
    -   Upon config of new FF, should wipe scan array to force new scan on tick
    -   Double check error checking:
        -   chunk-unload friendly
    -   Default to:
        -   Mob: Perimeter
        -   Build: Volume
-   Clean up placement actionbar
    -   Use ff_building_helper to get data
-   Make Multiplayer Friendly! Associate player ID to corners (also preface for "ownable" fields)
-   Normalize corner and data storage data structure formats
    -   That includes scanning lookups, etc... Try to use STORAGE where possible
-   Corner protection (beyond the Protect Boundary)
    -   Needs to push back non-owners (really fuck 'em up without hurting them) to ensure they stay safe from punching
-   Bug: Corners near each other don't handle break detection correctly
    -   Armor stand is left behind
-   Bug: When player destroys starting corner they keep tags.. need to once more detect breakage ðŸ¤ª
    -   Convert current corner destroy detection to all corners instead of just configured
    -   Also needs to kill `ff_building_helper`
    -   Dropped items from corners should be tagged for more accurate destroying (instead of destroying in a block zone around detected breaking)
-   Bug: Items are still dropping when a corner is destroyed
    -   Try tagging the items on the stand, and when they drop just del them `@e[type=item,tag=ff_corner_armor]`
-   Bug: When multiple FF's exist, entering/leaving an area gets wonky real quick
-   Bug: When building, a player that's technically closer will take control
    -   Needs to error if >= 2 players found within 5 (or 6) radius of newly placed corners (to avoid mis-writing)
-   Bug: Power mod status doesn't affect matching corner
    -   Might need an `operations` namespace/process?
    -   Doesn't actually have an effect on the FF
-   HUGE bug: Array loopings operate on a copy now, so operations that assume index 0 to be the current are invalid
    -   Need to copy back after search in every instance
        -   CREATE
        -   UPDATE
        -   DELETE
-   Bug: Enabling/Disabling a single FF seems to affect ALL FF's in a scan...
-   Revisit admin book, make sure terminology and functionality matches new processing and implementation(s)
    -   Add info about settings and meanings
    -   Cover protection area better
-   Enchance corner tooltips, they're bland and boring. Might need multi-line!
